# MultiSearch
A simple tool to use one search term that opens up multiple searches in different search engines. Use the keyword "ms" in the omnibox followed by the search term.

Click on the extension icon to open the options page where you can add/remove search engines to use. They use the same format as keyword searches with %s as the variable, e.g:

https://www.google.com/search?q=%s
